# AI-Based Railway Grievance Resolution Portal

## Overview
An intelligent web application designed to streamline railway complaint management using machine learning and AI technologies. The system automatically categorizes complaints, predicts urgency levels, and provides real-time assistance through an AI chatbot.

## Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Functionality
- **Automatic Department Classification**: ML model categorizes complaints into appropriate railway departments
- **Urgency Prediction**: Advanced stacking model predicts complaint urgency (Low/Medium/High) using TF-IDF and numerical features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time sentiment analysis of user feedback using TextBlob
- **AI Chatbot**: Rail Sahayak - An intelligent assistant powered by Ollama's TinyLLama model

### üë• Multi-Role System
- **Users**: Submit complaints, track status, provide feedback
- **Employees**: Manage assigned complaints, mark as resolved
- **Admins**: Department-wise dashboard, employee management, analytics

### üìä Analytics & Insights
- Real-time complaint tracking and status updates
- Sentiment analysis dashboard with visual charts
- Employee performance metrics
- Feedback trend analysis over time
